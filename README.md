# Diabetes_Prediction
In this project, i created a model to predict if a person has diabetes or not depending on some features whicha are explained in the .ipynb file along with the code
i carried out extensive data analysis to identify the trend and any insight that could be gotten from the data
I did some feature engineering to fill in missing values, generally clean up the data and make it ready to be trained on
I tried different machine learning models on it, to get the best and was able to tune it further to get a good outcome
